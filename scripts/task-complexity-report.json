      "taskTitle": "Implement Search Agent with Keyword Discovery",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Search Agent implementation into subtasks covering API client development, search functionality, result normalization, deduplication logic, and LangGraph integration. Include specific technical considerations for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple API integrations with error handling, data normalization across sources, and integration into a workflow system. The complexity comes from handling different data formats, implementing rate limiting, and ensuring proper error handling across external services."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Enrichment Agent for Metadata Collection",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Enrichment Agent implementation into subtasks covering RSS feed processing, social media discovery and analysis, data standardization and merging, audience size estimation, workflow integration, and error handling for external data sources.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the variety of external data sources (RSS feeds, social media) that need to be processed, analyzed, and merged. The audience size estimation algorithms and handling of potentially unreliable external data add significant complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop CRM Agent with Direct Attio Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CRM Agent development into subtasks covering Attio API client implementation, direct lead export functionality, campaign tagging and organization, bidirectional sync logic, and error recovery mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves direct integration with an external CRM system API, requiring authentication, error handling, and bidirectional data synchronization. The complexity comes from ensuring reliable data transfer and handling potential API failures gracefully."
