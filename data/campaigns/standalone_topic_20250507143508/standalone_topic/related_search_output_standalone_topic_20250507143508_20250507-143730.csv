You are not alone.  Many of us are told we are healthy but don’t feel great.  You feel tired, your sex drive has disappeared and you are frustrated with your weight, despite a healthy diet and exercise. At night you are exhausted, but your sleep quality is poor from waking up throughout the night. 

Needless to say, you’re irritable and your patience is short, which makes you feel guilty for overreacting.  It is not your fault! These are all signs of hormone-imbalances. 

Our hormones can affect our mood, weight, energy, sleep, libido, memory, hair, skin and even promote disease if they are out of balance. 

Dr. Robert Maki and Dr. Valorie Davidson are Naturopathic Physicians and graduates of Bastyr University.  They specialize in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT), Functional Medicine and are the co-hosts of The Progress Your Health Podcast. 

This podcast is intended to educate listeners about hormonal conditions, such as hypothyroid, Hashimoto’s, adrenal fatigue, PMS, PCOS, perimenopause, menopause and low testosterone to name a few.

We’re here to rewrite these chapters, to change her story.

Your hosts, Dr. Angela McCool-Pearson and Dr. Christy Guepet, are board-certified gynecologists and certified menopause specialists. But more importantly, they’re menopausal women themselves. They’ve dedicated their careers to women’s health, and they’re deeply committed to helping women age well through midlife and beyond.

This isn’t just clinical expertise; it’s personal. It’s a message of hope and humor, armed with scientific data and real-life experiences. We believe the best is truly yet to come.

With a passion for educating women about the changes happening in their bodies, Dr. Pearson and Dr. Guepet want to empower you to think about the impact these changes have on your life. They’re here to serve as your interpreters, cutting through the noise and offering SWS solutions for the good life – solutions they choose for themselves and offer to their patients.

Their goal is a natural result: not to change you, but to reveal you. To help you rediscover a part of yourself you might have lost, and uncover a part you never knew was there. Have you missed yourself? It’s time for a reintroduction. They can help you reintroduce yourself.

Let’s be real: aging well is hard work. But it’s absolutely doable, and we are right there with you. Because if you don’t feel good, you might miss out on those precious moments – enjoying your kids, your parents, travel, intimacy, and more. When your body is functioning at its best, you open yourself up to a life filled with joy.

Welcome to Season 1 of ”This is Menopause,” where we’ll dive into the nuances of gynecology, explore the benefits of hormone replacement therapy, and discuss intimate health and medical aesthetics tailored specifically for you. Imagine if these stethoscopes could talk...

Join us as we share expert insights, real-life stories, and practical advice to help you embrace this stage of life with confidence and vitality. We’re redefining midlife. We are right there with you. This is your time, your journey—this is menopause.

podscan,pd_a86x53kzxvvjwgdv,Fungi!,"The Power of Fungi: Nature's Unseen Allies Introduction Fungi, often overlooked and underappreciated, are emerging as one of nature's most powerful allies in addressing some of mankind's most pressing challenges. From environmental restoration to medicine, and sustainable agriculture to bioengineering, these incredible organisms are proving their worth in numerous fields. This blog delves into the multifaceted ways fungi are contributing to the betterment of humanity, inspired by the innovative use of mushrooms to rejuvenate toxic brownfields into blooming meadows, as highlighted in a recent article on the Good News Network. Environmental Restoration Fungi, particularly mushrooms, play a pivotal role in environmental restoration. One groundbreaking application is the use of mycoremediation, where fungi are employed to decompose and detoxify environmental contaminants. This process involves leveraging the natural ability of fungi to break down complex organic substances, including pollutants like hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Mycoremediation: Turning Brownfields Green The article on the Good News Network showcases a project where mushrooms are used to transform toxic brownfields—areas contaminated by industrial activity—into flourishing green spaces. The fungi's mycelium network breaks down toxins in the soil, making it fertile and safe for plant growth. This not only restores the land but also promotes biodiversity and ecological health. This innovative approach to land reclamation is a testament to the power of fungi in environmental cleanup. Case Study: Oyster Mushrooms and Hydrocarbon Pollution Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) have been extensively studied for their ability to degrade hydrocarbons, the primary components of petroleum products. In various experiments, these mushrooms have demonstrated an impressive capacity to break down diesel fuel and crude oil, converting them into non-toxic substances. The mycelium of oyster mushrooms secretes enzymes that effectively dismantle the complex molecules found in hydrocarbons, rendering them harmless. This process not only detoxifies the soil but also allows for the reintroduction of vegetation, turning once barren lands into thriving ecosystems. Heavy Metal Detoxification Fungi also play a crucial role in the detoxification of heavy metals from contaminated sites. Mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, can immobilize heavy metals like cadmium, lead, and mercury, reducing their bioavailability and preventing them from entering the food chain. These fungi secrete organic acids that bind to the heavy metals, effectively sequestering them within the soil matrix. This natural process is a sustainable alternative to conventional methods of heavy metal remediation, which often involve harsh chemicals and significant financial investment. Medicine and Health Fungi have been a cornerstone in medicine for centuries, with penicillin, derived from the Penicillium mold, being one of the most famous examples. Today, the medical potential of fungi extends far beyond antibiotics. Many mushrooms are rich in bioactive compounds that possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties. The Medicinal Mushrooms: Reishi, Shiitake, and Beyond Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and shiitake (Lentinula edodes) mushrooms are two of the most well-known medicinal mushrooms. Reishi mushrooms contain compounds such as triterpenoids and polysaccharides, which have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce inflammation, and possess anti-tumor properties. Shiitake mushrooms, on the other hand, are rich in lentinan, a polysaccharide that has demonstrated potent anti-cancer effects in clinical studies. These mushrooms are not only used in traditional medicine but are also being incorporated into modern medical practices as complementary therapies. Antibiotic Resistance and Fungal Solutions As antibiotic resistance becomes an increasingly severe global health crisis, fungi are being explored for their potential in developing new antimicrobial agents. Fungi produce a wide array of secondary metabolites, many of which have potent antibacterial and antifungal properties. Researchers are investigating these natural compounds to develop novel antibiotics that can combat resistant strains of bacteria. For example, the fungal genus Aspergillus has yielded compounds like aspergillomarasmine, which shows promise in neutralizing antibiotic-resistant bacteria by inhibiting their resistance mechanisms. Fungi in Immunotherapy Fungi are also being used in the field of immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of cancer. Polysaccharides extracted from fungi such as Coriolus versicolor (Turkey tail mushroom) have been shown to modulate the immune system, enhancing the body's natural ability to fight cancer cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated that these fungal polysaccharides can improve the survival rates of cancer patients when used in conjunction with conventional therapies. This burgeoning field of research underscores the potential of fungi to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes. Sustainable Agriculture Fungi are revolutionizing sustainable agriculture through their symbiotic relationships with plants. Mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with plant roots, enhancing water and nutrient uptake, which leads to healthier and more resilient crops. This natural collaboration reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, promoting sustainable farming practices. Mycorrhizal Networks: The Underground Internet Mycorrhizal fungi form extensive networks that connect plant roots, allowing for the transfer of nutrients, water, and even signaling molecules between plants. This underground network, often referred to as the ""Wood Wide Web,"" is crucial for the health and resilience of ecosystems. Plants connected to mycorrhizal networks can share resources and support each other during periods of stress, such as drought or pest infestations. This mutualistic relationship enhances plant growth and productivity, reducing the need for chemical inputs and promoting sustainable agriculture. Organic Fertilizers and Soil Conditioners Fungi are also being used to create organic fertilizers and soil conditioners that improve soil health and fertility. Composting with fungi, particularly with species like Trichoderma, accelerates the decomposition of organic matter, producing nutrient-rich compost that enhances soil structure and fertility. Fungal compost not only provides essential nutrients to plants but also introduces beneficial microorganisms that promote soil health. This sustainable approach to soil management reduces the reliance on synthetic fertilizers, which can lead to soil degradation and environmental pollution. Biopesticides and Pest Control Fungi are increasingly being used as biopesticides to control agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, infect and kill insect pests, providing a natural and eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. These fungi are applied to crops as spores, which then infect and proliferate within the target pests, ultimately leading to their demise. This method of pest control is highly specific, targeting only the pest species while leaving beneficial insects unharmed. The use of fungal biopesticides helps to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and promotes sustainable farming practices. Bioengineering and Material Science The potential of fungi extends into the realm of bioengineering and material science. Fungi can be cultivated to produce biodegradable materials that offer sustainable alternatives to plastics and other non-renewable resources. Mycelium-Based Materials Mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, is being developed into a wide range of sustainable materials. Mycelium-based materials are created by growing fungal mycelium on agricultural waste substrates, which are then molded into various shapes and sizes. These materials are biodegradable, durable, and possess unique properties such as fire resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios. Mycelium-based materials are being used in packaging, construction, and even fashion, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional materials like plastics and Styrofoam. Construction and Architecture In the construction industry, mycelium-based materials are being explored for their potential to create sustainable building materials. Mycelium bricks, for example, are lightweight, strong, and provide excellent insulation properties. These bricks are made by growing mycelium on agricultural waste, which binds the waste particles together to form a solid structure. The resulting bricks are not only environmentally friendly but also offer unique aesthetic qualities. Additionally, mycelium-based materials can be used to create biodegradable insulation panels, reducing the environmental impact of construction and improving the sustainability of buildings. Fashion and Textiles The fashion industry is also exploring the potential of mycelium-based materials to create sustainable textiles. Mycelium leather, for instance, is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional leather made from animal hides. Mycelium leather is produced by growing mycelium on agricultural waste, which is then processed to create a material that mimics the look and feel of leather. This sustainable alternative reduces the environmental impact of leather production, which is associated with deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Mycelium-based textiles offer a promising solution to the environmental challenges facing the fashion industry.

Have you been trying to lose weight and can’t seem to shed an ounce, no matter what you try? Do you feel bloated after meals and know your hormones are probably out of whack, but have no idea how to get back on track? Do you keep trying the latest Instagram trend or what your girlfriends recommend when it comes to diet and exercise, but end up confused and gripped by analysis paralysis?


Are you constantly feeling exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep? Struggling with brain fog, stubborn weight gain, or just feeling ”off” no matter what you try? Do you want to make better food choices but feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting advice?
Hi, I’m Jennifer—a Christ follower, wife, and boy-mom who knows what it’s like to battle fatigue, hormone imbalances, and the frustration of not knowing how to truly nourish my body. I’ve been where you are, trying to juggle the demands of motherhood while searching for natural, holistic ways to feel better—without relying on quick fixes or medications.
After years of trial and error, I discovered the power of whole, God-given foods, simple lifestyle shifts, and natural remedies to restore energy, clear brain fog, and support my body the way it was designed to function. I created tools and systems to simplify healthy living—reducing decision fatigue, creating consistency in my meals, and making food enjoyable (even for picky eaters).
Health looks different for everyone, and I’m here to help you navigate that journey in a way that works for your body and your family. 🎙️ Tune in for practical tips, faith-filled encouragement, and no-nonsense strategies to nourish your family naturally—where vegetables aren’t the enemy.Let’s reclaim dinner, one carrot at a time! 🌱🇺🇸",https://feed.podbean.com/functionalmedicineandfaith/feed.xml,https://jennifercoble.com/,support@jennifercoble.com,1592981171,8668878c861045e2b789c9fd37377c2b,1743450394000,1633357740146,147,86,32,5%,31kPjDEutcwuBnOlksnfEw,900,5,24,,,2025-03-31T19:46:34+00:00,https://pbcdn1.podbean.com/imglogo/image-logo/12665766/Holistic_Health_For_Moms_Podcast_Cover_Art_1_9mnqu.jpg,,,,,,https://www.facebook.com/prayers4pax/,support@jennifercoble.com

podscan,pd_pmk29nn24pz9ev8n,Pickling: A Flavorful Journey Beyond Cucumbers,"<br>The Art of Pickling: A Flavorful Journey Beyond Cucumbers <br>Pickling is a time-honored tradition that transforms ordinary vegetables and fruits into tangy, crisp delicacies. While many associate pickling solely with cucumbers, this versatile preservation method can be applied to a wide array of produce, creating a pantry full of colorful, zesty treasures. Let's embark on a culinary adventure to explore the world of pickling and discover how to elevate your home cooking with these delightful preserved morsels. <br>At its core, pickling is the process of preserving food in an acidic medium. This can be achieved through fermentation, where natural bacteria produce lactic acid, or by adding vinegar to create a brine. The acidity not only preserves the food but also imparts that characteristic tangy flavor we associate with pickles. This ancient method of food preservation has been practiced for thousands of years, with evidence of pickling dating back to 2030 BCE in the Tigris Valley of India. <br>Before diving into the pickling process, it's essential to ensure your kitchen is properly equipped. High-quality glass jars with tight-fitting lids are a must, as is a large pot for boiling filled jars. A jar lifter is invaluable for safely removing hot jars from boiling water, while a canning funnel helps fill jars neatly. You'll also need a nonreactive saucepan for preparing brines and a sharp knife for precise cutting of vegetables and fruits. Some enthusiasts also invest in a mandoline for uniform slicing, particularly useful for vegetables like cucumbers and onions. <br>The beauty of pickling lies in its simplicity. Always choose the freshest vegetables or fruits for the best results. When selecting produce, look for items that are firm and free from blemishes. Cucumbers for pickling should be small and compact, with thin skins and minimal seeds. Vinegar forms the base of most pickling brines, with white, apple cider, or rice vinegar all being suitable options. Each type of vinegar imparts a unique flavor profile to your pickles, so don't be afraid to experiment. <br>Salt is crucial in pickling, but be sure to use pickling or kosher salt, avoiding iodized varieties which can cause discoloration and cloudiness in your brine. Sugar can be added to balance the acidity, though it's optional. Brown sugar or honey can be used for a more complex sweetness. Whole spices like mustard seeds, peppercorns, and dill seeds, along with fresh herbs such as dill, thyme, or bay leaves, add depth and complexity to your pickles. Garlic and ginger are also popular additions that can significantly impact the final flavor. <br>The pickling process begins with preparing your produce by washing and cutting it into desired shapes. For cucumbers, you might leave them whole for dill pickles, or slice them into spears or rounds for bread-and-butter pickles. Onions can be sliced into rings or quarters, while carrots might be cut into sticks or rounds. Next, create the brine by combining vinegar, water, salt, and any sugar or spices in a saucepan and bringing it to a boil. The ratio of vinegar to water can vary depending on the recipe, but a common starting point is equal parts vinegar and water. <br>While the brine heats, fill sterilized jars with your prepared produce and any additional spices or herbs. Packing the vegetables tightly helps prevent them from floating in the brine. Once the brine is ready, pour it over the produce, leaving a quarter-inch of headspace. This space is crucial as it allows for the expansion of the food during processing and creates a proper seal. Use a nonmetallic utensil to release any trapped air bubbles before sealing the jars and processing them in a boiling water bath if you're making shelf-stable pickles. <br>Quick pickles, also known as refrigerator pickles, offer a simpler alternative to traditional canning methods. These are made by pouring hot brine over produce and refrigerating. They're ready to eat within hours or days and will last for several weeks in the refrigerator. This method is perfect for small batches or when you want to experiment with flavors without committing to a large quantity. <br>On the other hand, fermented pickles rely on beneficial bacteria to create lactic acid. This process takes longer but results in complex flavors and potential probiotic benefits. Fermented pickles can last for months when properly stored. To make fermented pickles, vegetables are submerged in a salt brine and left to sit at room temperature for several days or weeks. During this time, beneficial bacteria convert the vegetable's natural sugars into lactic acid, which acts as a preservative and gives the pickles their characteristic tangy flavor. <br>While cucumbers are the most well-known pickle, a world of pickling possibilities awaits the adventurous cook. Carrots take on a vibrant crunch when pickled, perfect for adding to salads and sandwiches. Try flavoring them with cumin and coriander for a Moroccan twist. Red onions, when quick-pickled, brighten up tacos, burgers, and grain bowls with their vivid pink hue and zesty flavor. Don't discard those watermelon rinds – pickle them with cinnamon and cloves for a sweet and tangy treat reminiscent of the American South. <br>Green beans, when pickled, become crisp, savory snacks known as ""dilly beans,"" which also make elegant garnishes for Bloody Marys. For a delightful balance of sweet and sour, try pickling peaches, which pair beautifully with grilled meats or as part of a cheese board. Whole cloves of pickled garlic develop a mellow, complex flavor that's wonderful in salad dressings or mashed into compound butter. <br>Mushrooms, particularly small button or wild varieties, make excellent pickles and are a welcome addition to antipasto platters. The earthy sweetness of beets is enhanced by pickling; try adding star anise to the brine for an intriguing flavor profile. Quick-pickled radishes retain their peppery bite while taking on a pleasing tanginess, making them delightful in tacos or as a garnish for rich dishes. And while not a vegetable, pickled eggs are a classic bar snack that deserves a place in your pickling repertoire. <br>The art of pickling allows for endless creativity in developing flavor profiles. Consider an Asian-inspired pickle using rice vinegar, ginger, and star anise for a delicate, aromatic result. Or explore Indian flavors with turmeric, mustard seeds, and fenugreek seeds for a warm, complex taste. A herbal infusion of tarragon, thyme, and lemon zest makes for a bright, herbaceous pickle, while brown sugar and red pepper flakes create an intriguing balance of heat and sweetness. For a smoky depth, try incorporating chipotle peppers and cumin into your brine. <br>To ensure pickling success, always use the freshest produce possible for the best texture and flavor. Maintain cleanliness throughout the process to prevent contamination. For crisp pickles, try soaking vegetables in ice water for a few hours before pickling. This helps to maintain their crunch even after pickling. Don't be afraid to experiment with different vinegars to find your preferred flavor profile, and consider keeping a pickling journal to record your recipes and adjustments. <br>Homemade pickles are versatile additions to your culinary repertoire. Arrange an assortment of pickled vegetables alongside cured meats and cheeses for an impressive charcuterie board. Layer pickled onions or carrots on sandwiches for added crunch and zing, or chop pickled vegetables and toss them into green salads or grain bowls for extra flavor. Use pickled pearl onions or cornichons to garnish cocktails like martinis or Gibsons, or finely chop a variety of pickled vegetables to create unique relishes for hot dogs or burgers. Pickled mushrooms or cauliflower make excellent appetizers as part of an antipasto platter. For a thoughtful, handcrafted gift, consider packaging your homemade pickles in decorative jars. <br>Beyond its culinary applications, pickling offers several health and environmental benefits. It allows you to preserve surplus produce that might otherwise go to waste, reducing food waste. This is particularly valuable if you have a vegetable garden that produces more than you can eat fresh. Fermented pickles can introduce beneficial bacteria to your diet, supporting gut health. These probiotics may aid in digestion and boost the immune system. By making your own pickles, you can control the amount of salt used, potentially reducing sodium intake compared to store-bought varieties. <br>Pickling also enables you to enjoy seasonal produce throughout the year. Imagine savoring the taste of summer tomatoes in the depths of winter, or enjoying crisp spring radishes when snow covers the ground. This connection to seasonality can help foster a greater appreciation for the natural cycles of food production. Moreover, pickling connects us to age-old food preservation techniques and cultural culinary practices. Nearly every culture around the world has its own pickling traditions, from German sauerkraut to Korean kimchi to Indian achaar. <br>As you delve deeper into the world of pickling, you may find yourself viewing your garden or farmers' market haul in a new light. Suddenly, every vegetable becomes a potential pickle, and your culinary creativity knows no bounds. You might start experimenting with unusual combinations, like pickled grapes with rosemary, or jalapeno-pickled pineapple for a spicy-sweet treat. <br>Start small with quick pickles, then gradually expand your repertoire to include fermented varieties and more unusual produce. You might begin with a simple batch of dill pickles, then move on to spicy pickled okra or tangy pickled cherries. Before long, you'll have a pantry full of colorful jars, each containing a unique flavor experience waiting to be savored. <br>Remember, pickling is both a science and an art.
