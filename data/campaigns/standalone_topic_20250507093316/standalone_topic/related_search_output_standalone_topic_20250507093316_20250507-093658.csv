You are not alone.  Many of us are told we are healthy but don’t feel great.  You feel tired, your sex drive has disappeared and you are frustrated with your weight, despite a healthy diet and exercise. At night you are exhausted, but your sleep quality is poor from waking up throughout the night. 

Needless to say, you’re irritable and your patience is short, which makes you feel guilty for overreacting.  It is not your fault! These are all signs of hormone-imbalances. 

Our hormones can affect our mood, weight, energy, sleep, libido, memory, hair, skin and even promote disease if they are out of balance.

I'm your host, Maraya Brown. I'm a Yale and functional medicine trained women's health and wellness expert, midwife, mom, keynote speaker and self-made seven-figure entrepreneur.

I love helping women move from exhausted to energized, balance their hormones, and feel turned on by their life, their lover, and themselves.  

You’re here for a more holistic and practical approach because you find yourself lost amidst the multitude of options and the growing health challenges women face today. I promise that you've come to the right place.

This podcast aims to equip women with the necessary tools to empower themselves and to reclaim their hope, restore their well-being, and ultimately regain control of their lives. No longer should women be confined to enduring chronic symptoms and conditions that diminish their health and overall quality of life.

Among the many subjects for women's health and wellness, we'll be covering topics like energy, hormones, libido, and embracing feminine power. Discover how to regain energy, address hormone concerns, and overcome gut, adrenal, and thyroid issues. We'll explore strategies for dealing with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and loss of libido. 

Through a functional medicine approach, we'll tackle exhaustion, brain fog, toxicity, menstrual irregularities, disconnection, irritability, and anxiety. Gain insights into adrenal health, gut health, liver health, thyroid health, sexual health, and libido, empowering you to feel vibrant and excited about the future.

We will also spend time addressing any feelings around our female anatomy, vaginal discharge and relationship with sexuality. You’ll learn quickly that my approach also honors the value of mindset and emotions every step of the way. 

There are answers OUTSIDE of an expensive shelf of supplements, lots of appointments with even more providers and lots of tests that all tell you things are “normal” when you don’t feel normal. 

Instead, we’ll work on streamlined, result-oriented diet, lifestyle and mindset modification with specialized testing options and hand picked supplementation.

What is functional medicine?

Functional Medicine goes beyond surface-level symptom management, focusing instead on identifying the underlying causes of health issues. By exploring how problems manifest throughout the body, this approach aims to uncover the root mechanisms and provide effective solutions. 

Unlike traditional medicine, it acknowledges that imbalances can exist without overt disease, even if lab tests appear normal. Prevention and optimal well-being are key goals, with functional medicine emphasizing disease avoidance rather than symptom suppression through pharmaceuticals. When illness arises, personalized healing approaches are pursued, often without relying on medications or surgery. With the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, functional medicine offers promising potential for reversing or preventing illnesses and fostering holistic healing.

What is women’s health and wellness?

Women's health and wellness encompasses the holistic well-being of women, addressing their physical, mental, and emotional health. It recognizes the unique needs and challenges faced by women throughout different life stages, including reproductive health, hormonal balance, sexual wellness, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. This comprehensive approach extends beyond the absence of illness, emphasizing self-care, preventive measures, and a balanced lifestyle. Women's health and wellness involve nurturing practices like regular exercise, healthy nutrition, stress management, mental health support, and nurturing relationships. Empowering women to make informed decisions and prioritize their well-being, it promotes self-advocacy and an empowered approach to healthcare.",https://thewomensvibrancycode.libsyn.com/rss,http://www.thewomensvibrancycode.com?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website,maraya@marayabrown.com,1603926195,8bb449de5da14c928c9521529146052c,1746608400000,1641816023161,176,167,37,2.5%,,1100,4.8,54,,,,https://cdn-images-3.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-womens-vibrancy-code-womens-health-and-J9PdZhIfBVs-aZwG8lmDpIY.1400x1400.jpg,https://www.instagram.com/loveyourbodyloveyourselfalways,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/maraya-brown-141a8120b,https://www.tiktok.com/@_marayabrown_,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClFktw3TpnSzo5Pkgm2us8A,https://www.facebook.com/energyhormoneslibido,maraya@marayabrown.com

****TOP 1.5% PODCAST (global ranking)****

Are you discouraged and overwhelmed by autoimmunity or chronic symptoms? Do you want more energy and less anxiety so that you can do “all the things”? Are you searching for meal ideas, essential oils, and other holistic treatments so that you can finally feel better?

In this podcast, you will learn empowering principles and simple, practical solutions that can provide vibrant health to your heart, soul, mind, and body. My mission is to encourage you to seek God’s wisdom first for your health and your life so that you can experience true, lasting healing that will allow you to make a greater eternal impact in your home and community. So, if you’re ready to step into the freedom that God has already given to you, then this podcast is for you.

Hi, I’m Alexandra. I love Jesus. I’m a wife and mom of three children. I am also a driven Registered Nurse with years of experience in the clinical research industry. When I experienced nagging health symptoms of my own, God opened my eyes to his loving provision and powerful tools for health—principles that are rarely talked about in my line of work. When I finally decided to stop my mind-numbing striving towards the picture that I had in my head of ”the next best thing”, I started to see God’s biblical truths at work all around me. I learned that Jesus is the source of healing for every aspect of my life.

Are you ready to discover some powerful, sustainable, non-toxic principles for your health (like real foods, essential oils, and other holistic treatments)? Are you willing to let your creator empower you with his wisdom so that you can experience more energy, joy, peace, and overall healing for your heart, soul, mind, and body? If so, then this is the show for you!

So go ahead and brew some herbal tea. Let’s take a break from the mind-numbing, humdrum “busyness.” Let’s rest and let God be our Healer and Helper.

The host, Melissa Bottorff-Arey, lost her 21-year-old son, Alex, to suicide on August 7, 2016, and brings (&amp; often shares) her insights from her personal journey.&nbsp;<br><br>In each episode, Melissa engages in honest and challenging conversations with other survivors of loss, healers, and mental health experts. She also produces shorter solo episodes where she reflects on her own thoughts and experiences thus far. The podcast covers a wide range of relevant topics and addresses difficult questions. Melissa explores all aspects of grief, including trauma, hope, healing, self-care, legacy, and stigma. She believes that we learn to live alongside our grief rather than get ing over it. Actual change comes through authentic, meaningful connections and mindful choices.&nbsp;<br><br>For supporters or educators, these conversations provide valuable insights and shine a light on suicide and grief genuinely and unapologetically. Listeners who are grieving a suicide loss can find comfort in the community and hope for a better tomorrow. Melissa aims to help others, like herself, transition from merely surviving to discovering a life filled with meaning and, potentially, even happiness amid the leftover pieces around you.<br><br><br></p><p>[Please NOTE: This podcast is for only relational, informational, and entertainment purposes.

Are you a woman with autoimmune disease or chronic illness? Are you so tired of feeling tired and going to doctor after doctor and trying the different naturopathic methods, all the different diets, and literally nothing sticking? Nothing is helping you?

Autoimmune Disease and Chronic Illness are difficult to navigate and you’re often doing it on your own. Doctors can test, maybe diagnose, and medicate, but what they can’t do is help you when you’re at home, living it out. I’m here for you friend.

Hi! I’m Marian Mitchell Byous, an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach. For the past 9 years, I’ve specialized in working with people who were struggling with complex chronic health conditions helping them regain their health through food and therapeutic diet solutions. 

I’ve been on the diet rollercoaster trying to heal myself and my family too. I’ve done every major dietary lifestyle out there trying to heal my migraines, psoriasis, ongoing GI issues, acne, and insanely painful periods. When my dad was diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis and my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, I knew I had to make living healthy realistic, simple, and enjoyable. I wanted all of us to live symptom-free and feel like we’re able to participate in all of life. It had to be easy or it wouldn’t happen. That became my mission.

My realistic approach to therapeutic diets and food is unique. I know that you have a life. You aren’t just your disease (or multiple diseases). You have a job, a partner, a family, obligations, friends, parties, and places to go explore. You’re already tired and feel awful, you can’t live in your kitchen, spend $1500 a month on food and supplements, and never go out. The last thing you need is to add a super restrictive diet that leaves you hungry, tired, and stressed out. Getting healthy should not be miserable and it doesn’t have to be.

I’m excited to share with you my heart and passion for making eating different and living healthy effortless. It truly can be! It’s all about being strategic and realistic while focusing on the positive. You have SO much in your control! In fact, diet and lifestyle account for 80% of your health outcomes! I want you to feel empowered and excited for your road to regaining your health and feeling amazing again.

Have you been trying to lose weight and can’t seem to shed an ounce, no matter what you try? Do you feel bloated after meals and know your hormones are probably out of whack, but have no idea how to get back on track? Do you keep trying the latest Instagram trend or what your girlfriends recommend when it comes to diet and exercise, but end up confused and gripped by analysis paralysis?


Are you constantly feeling exhausted, even after a full night’s sleep? Struggling with brain fog, stubborn weight gain, or just feeling ”off” no matter what you try? Do you want to make better food choices but feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting advice?
Hi, I’m Jennifer—a Christ follower, wife, and boy-mom who knows what it’s like to battle fatigue, hormone imbalances, and the frustration of not knowing how to truly nourish my body. I’ve been where you are, trying to juggle the demands of motherhood while searching for natural, holistic ways to feel better—without relying on quick fixes or medications.
After years of trial and error, I discovered the power of whole, God-given foods, simple lifestyle shifts, and natural remedies to restore energy, clear brain fog, and support my body the way it was designed to function. I created tools and systems to simplify healthy living—reducing decision fatigue, creating consistency in my meals, and making food enjoyable (even for picky eaters).
Health looks different for everyone, and I’m here to help you navigate that journey in a way that works for your body and your family. 🎙️ Tune in for practical tips, faith-filled encouragement, and no-nonsense strategies to nourish your family naturally—where vegetables aren’t the enemy.Let’s reclaim dinner, one carrot at a time! 🌱🇺🇸",https://feed.podbean.com/functionalmedicineandfaith/feed.xml,https://jennifercoble.com/,support@jennifercoble.com,1592981171,8668878c861045e2b789c9fd37377c2b,1743450394000,1633357740146,147,86,32,5%,31kPjDEutcwuBnOlksnfEw,900,5,24,,,2025-03-31T19:46:34+00:00,https://pbcdn1.podbean.com/imglogo/image-logo/12665766/Holistic_Health_For_Moms_Podcast_Cover_Art_1_9mnqu.jpg,,,,,,https://www.facebook.com/prayers4pax/,support@jennifercoble.com

Have you tried sticking with meal plans, workout programs or daily devotions, only to fall off because it feels like too much?

 If so, you’re in the right place! This podcast will help you find the time and mental space to create simple holistic health habits and daily routines, so you can feel peace  in motherhood, and lean into creating consistency, for a more intentional, powerful, healthy you!
   
I’m Caroline, a homeschooling mother of 4 amazing kids, holistic wellness nerd, and a lover of all things natural! I have tried all kinds of “healthy” approaches to my wellness over the years, but it left me exhausted! I was tired of feeling pulled in so many directions, without the time or energy to prioritize the health and life I wanted. 

I finally started to experience a shift in my wellness, starting with my mental health, when I began working through old identity patterns and limiting beliefs. I began building simple routines that allowed me to experience more peace and purpose in motherhood, and time to pursue true health and a deeper relationship with God. 

Now I help mothers like you:

- Build Christ-centered routines that are realistic for mom life
- Cultivate a deeper faith that leads to peace and clarity
- Prioritize health without the mom guilt
- Boost energy, mood, and sleep with holistic solutions
- Ditch burnout and embrace balance

 Grab your favorite mug of warm goodness, pop in those earbuds, and let’s go reset your mind, body, and spirit- together!

Do you wake up feeling tired?
Struggle to stay focused all day?
Are you frustrated that nothing seems to help you lose weight?
Is balancing your health and busy life starting to feel impossible?
Are you tired of being told “everything looks normal” when you know deep down something’s off?

I’m so glad you’re here! This podcast is your go-to resource to finally take control of your health, feel normal again—energized, clear-headed, and bloat-free—so you can achieve lasting weight loss and confidently show up for the life and people you love.

Hey, I’m Lacy Lain, wife, mom, international best-selling author, and Functional Health Practitioner. For years, I searched for answers to my chronic health and hormone struggles within the conventional medical system.

I was desperate for a natural solution to address what my body truly needed. But all I found were dismissals like “everything looks normal,” prescriptions I didn’t want, endless referrals, and even “maybe it’s all in your head.”

I finally realized that to feel like myself again, I had to take my health into my own hands and uncover the root causes of the imbalances holding me back.

Through functional medicine, I created a personalized health plan tailored to MY body, and now I’m here to help YOU do the same.

If you’re ready to:
- Find a solution uniquely tailored to YOUR body.
- Discover natural, holistic strategies for lasting health.
- Reclaim your energy, lose weight, balance hormones, and feel clear-headed again…

Pull up a chair, grab your notebook, and let’s dive in!

podscan,pd_p6km5akllww94lae,"Holistic Health Strategies for Moms | Dietary Supplements, Vaccines, Natural Remedies, Healthy Recipes","Do you feel unheard and dismissed by the medical system because you’re “just a mom”?

Are you tired of spending too much time trying to find answers to your health concerns but not knowing who/what you can trust?

Do you wish that you could cut through the noise and understand the research you’re finding? What’s real and what’s not?

Are you frustrated by a medical system that appears to focus more on sickcare than healthcare?

Don’t worry, you’re not alone!

This podcast was created to give you the confidence you need to make informed medical decisions. You won’t have to struggle anymore knowing how to answer people who disagree with your choices, and you will learn simple tips to read the research and make the decisions you need to make for your family with confidence.

Hi, I’m Heather. I’m a wife, mom, and certified health educator passionate about helping people know more and fear less. For years, I made healthcare decisions that were a bit unconventional, but I never felt confident about my choices because I lacked knowledge of how the system worked, and it seemed too confusing.

Over the years, I’ve learned to listen to my gut, and I went back to school to know the truth about health. That experience helped me create a fear-shattering system that has helped me navigate this arena with increasing confidence. Now, I am here to share it with you!

Together, we will cut through the noise and navigate the tricky landscape of insurance and doctor partnerships, medical conflicts of interest, the history of various medical procedures, and follow the money trail. I’ll also answer your questions on the topics you’re asking real questions about, like vaccines, health insurance, natural home solutions, and an optimal diet.

If you are ready to debunk some health myths with reliable research,
Expose the lies that are holding you back,
Gain real strategy and confidence surrounding your healthcare decisions,
And do all of that while keeping up with your busy mom life…

I discovered a 3-step process that not only addressed MY chronic constipation, bloating, acid reflux, and hormone imbalance but also worked for my clients, too.

Now - I’m ready to share it with you!

If you are ready to find all natural remedies to constipation, bloating, acid reflux, and hormone imbalance that continue to work after you’ve done them - then this podcast is for you!

Put on your comfiest clothes and plug this in for your next car ride. It’s time to fix your gut!

podscan,pd_ndbka52g7q4j2gez,"Rise Up From Fatigue - Increase Energy, Stress Management, Natural Remedies, Gut Health, Non-Toxic Living","Do you wish you had more energy throughout your day? 
Do you want to feel good in your body and gain confidence in tackling the overwhelming things?  
Tired of feeling drained, exhausted, or fatigued on a daily basis?  

I’m so excited you’re here! In this podcast I’m going to help you find more energy, feel less exhausted, and feel like a new person, all while honoring the Lord in how you care for the body that He’s given you.

“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.” 1 Corinthians 6:19-20

Hi! I’m Melissa! I love Jesus, I’m a wife and a dog mom.  For years, I battled the endless list of symptoms with fatigue right in the mix.  Struggling to get up in the morning and make it through the day.  I used every bit of energy I had at work, and came home completely exhausted, unable to do anything else productive.

I was chasing the symptoms, trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Diet protocols one right after the other, and spending countless hours searching for answers.

I realized in order to get real answers and stop hearing ”nothing’s wrong” from every doctor I talked to, I needed to look outside the mainstream medical system. I started advocating for myself and discovered that natural solutions and healthy lifestyle changes were the key to me healing from the fatigue and other chronic symptoms I was struggling with.  God was opening my eyes throughout the process to the deceptions and the truth of how we are called to care for our body.

Once I began implementing these natural solutions, I was healthier and more energized, and I could finally make the impact for the Kingdom I had been dreaming about, but was just too tired to act on. And it’s my hope and prayer for you that you can do the same.

If you are ready to…….

Have more energy
Feel like a new person
Have confidence in  tackling things that have “normally” felt overwhelming
Do more and feel more like yourself
Have better stress management routines
Be a healthier person overall - this podcast is for you!


Grab your filtered water and turn off those notifications.  It’s time to get you out of 
survival mode and into thriving!

We'll speak with fellow patients and renowned doctors to help gain a better understanding of some of the less talked about topics of managing these diseases.</p>
<p>At CreakyJoints Australia we are on a mission to raise awareness and deepen the collective understanding of arthritis, a disease which has more than 200 variations, empowering patients to put themselves at the centre of their own health. </p>
<p>In Patient PrepRheum, we are looking at three key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Biosimilars - a group of biologic medicines used to slow and stop the progression of Autoimmune arthritis;</li>
<li>How medications are approved via the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and</li>
<li>the importance of good patient-doctor communication.</li>
