****TOP 1.5% PODCAST (global ranking)****

Are you discouraged and overwhelmed by autoimmunity or chronic symptoms? Do you want more energy and less anxiety so that you can do “all the things”? Are you searching for meal ideas, essential oils, and other holistic treatments so that you can finally feel better?

In this podcast, you will learn empowering principles and simple, practical solutions that can provide vibrant health to your heart, soul, mind, and body. My mission is to encourage you to seek God’s wisdom first for your health and your life so that you can experience true, lasting healing that will allow you to make a greater eternal impact in your home and community. So, if you’re ready to step into the freedom that God has already given to you, then this podcast is for you.

Hi, I’m Alexandra. I love Jesus. I’m a wife and mom of three children. I am also a driven Registered Nurse with years of experience in the clinical research industry. When I experienced nagging health symptoms of my own, God opened my eyes to his loving provision and powerful tools for health—principles that are rarely talked about in my line of work. When I finally decided to stop my mind-numbing striving towards the picture that I had in my head of ”the next best thing”, I started to see God’s biblical truths at work all around me. I learned that Jesus is the source of healing for every aspect of my life.

Are you ready to discover some powerful, sustainable, non-toxic principles for your health (like real foods, essential oils, and other holistic treatments)? Are you willing to let your creator empower you with his wisdom so that you can experience more energy, joy, peace, and overall healing for your heart, soul, mind, and body? If so, then this is the show for you!

So go ahead and brew some herbal tea. Let’s take a break from the mind-numbing, humdrum “busyness.” Let’s rest and let God be our Healer and Helper.

The Go-to Podcast for Midlife Women Who Want To Balance Hormones Naturally 

Ugh. I feel so bloated. I’m retaining more water than the Hoover Dam.

What? Not another pimple? It’s like puberty all over again!

Sleep? What’s that like? (I forget.:＜)

Umm, I just turned 40….. Aren’t I too young for this?!?

—

Hello Friend. 

(Can I call you “friend”? ‘Cuz we’re already friends in my head:) Welcome to Are You There, Midlife? It’s Me, Monica.

I’m Monica Lane Topete, Certified Nutrition Coach Coach, Peri+ Menopause Educator, Personal Trainer, NASM Behavior Change Specialist, and Hormone Imbalance Survivor. And I’m on a mission to help women in mid life balance their hormones naturally without drugs, doctors (or divorce!)

It wasn’t too long ago when perimenopause came crashing through my door with a ton of luggage (‘cuz she was prepared to stay for A WHILE!) I remember how overwhelmed, anxious, and pretty much clueless I was about what was happening to my body…and how desperate I was for a diagnosis! But, after SEVERAL visits to my doctor who gave me a clean bill of health and lab results that came back “within normal range,” I finally decided to take my health into my own hands. 

I spent OVER A YEAR combing through PubMed research studies, taking online courses in naturopathy and functional medicine, and becoming my own human guinea pig to crack the hormone code and create a research-based program that really worked to balance my hormones, put the kibosh on perimenopause symptoms, and lose stubborn weight–and keep it off–for more than 10 years! 

And now, I want to share it with you.

Join me as I demystify the hormonal transition in midlife and spill the ”tea” on what to expect when you’re expecting perimenopause…and beyond. From anxiety to insomnia, body fat to funky body odor (yeah, that’s a thing!), I’ll unpack all the ”weird stuff” going on inside our midlife bodies, plus give you the latest science and holistic solutions to balance it all.

...Are you tired of dealing with heavy, painful periods that look like a crime scene?… 

...Or struggling with symptoms like chronic headaches, fatigue, or brain fog that….(What was I saying again?).... 

...Are you beyond frustrated doing “all the things” to lose weight—but are still packing on the pounds faster than a sumo wrestler in training

Then, girl, you’re in the right place.:)

There IS a way you can balance your hormones naturally that doesn’t involve band-aid solutions like antidepressants or birth control pills (which are a BIG mistake! HUGE!)...and that only provide temporary relief without fixing the root problem.

In this podcast, you’ll learn how to:

- End painful periods, menstrual headaches, and PMS

- Improve your sleep, reduce night sweats, and increase your overall energy
 
- Reduce hormonal depression and anxiety–WITHOUT meds!

- Alleviate symptoms of inflammation like joint pain, hair loss, gut issues, and allergies

- Move the scale on stubborn weight and belly fat (and never starve yourself again!)

- Talk to your partner about perimenopause (without sounding like you’re totally insane!)

It’s TIME to take back control of your hormones and show ‘em who’s boss...so you can feel confident and love yourself again!

...Without ever stepping foot inside a doctor’s office or resorting to crazy hormone pellets. 

No need to make an appointment or even change outta your PJs. Just come as you are–wherever you are–as I discuss ALL things hormones in midlife–with a bit of saucy humor.

(‘Cuz laughing is better than crying, unless it makes you pee.:)

podscan,pd_a86x53kzxvvjwgdv,Fungi!,"The Power of Fungi: Nature's Unseen Allies Introduction Fungi, often overlooked and underappreciated, are emerging as one of nature's most powerful allies in addressing some of mankind's most pressing challenges. From environmental restoration to medicine, and sustainable agriculture to bioengineering, these incredible organisms are proving their worth in numerous fields. This blog delves into the multifaceted ways fungi are contributing to the betterment of humanity, inspired by the innovative use of mushrooms to rejuvenate toxic brownfields into blooming meadows, as highlighted in a recent article on the Good News Network. Environmental Restoration Fungi, particularly mushrooms, play a pivotal role in environmental restoration. One groundbreaking application is the use of mycoremediation, where fungi are employed to decompose and detoxify environmental contaminants. This process involves leveraging the natural ability of fungi to break down complex organic substances, including pollutants like hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Mycoremediation: Turning Brownfields Green The article on the Good News Network showcases a project where mushrooms are used to transform toxic brownfields—areas contaminated by industrial activity—into flourishing green spaces. The fungi's mycelium network breaks down toxins in the soil, making it fertile and safe for plant growth. This not only restores the land but also promotes biodiversity and ecological health. This innovative approach to land reclamation is a testament to the power of fungi in environmental cleanup. Case Study: Oyster Mushrooms and Hydrocarbon Pollution Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) have been extensively studied for their ability to degrade hydrocarbons, the primary components of petroleum products. In various experiments, these mushrooms have demonstrated an impressive capacity to break down diesel fuel and crude oil, converting them into non-toxic substances. The mycelium of oyster mushrooms secretes enzymes that effectively dismantle the complex molecules found in hydrocarbons, rendering them harmless. This process not only detoxifies the soil but also allows for the reintroduction of vegetation, turning once barren lands into thriving ecosystems. Heavy Metal Detoxification Fungi also play a crucial role in the detoxification of heavy metals from contaminated sites. Mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, can immobilize heavy metals like cadmium, lead, and mercury, reducing their bioavailability and preventing them from entering the food chain. These fungi secrete organic acids that bind to the heavy metals, effectively sequestering them within the soil matrix. This natural process is a sustainable alternative to conventional methods of heavy metal remediation, which often involve harsh chemicals and significant financial investment. Medicine and Health Fungi have been a cornerstone in medicine for centuries, with penicillin, derived from the Penicillium mold, being one of the most famous examples. Today, the medical potential of fungi extends far beyond antibiotics. Many mushrooms are rich in bioactive compounds that possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties. The Medicinal Mushrooms: Reishi, Shiitake, and Beyond Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and shiitake (Lentinula edodes) mushrooms are two of the most well-known medicinal mushrooms. Reishi mushrooms contain compounds such as triterpenoids and polysaccharides, which have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce inflammation, and possess anti-tumor properties. Shiitake mushrooms, on the other hand, are rich in lentinan, a polysaccharide that has demonstrated potent anti-cancer effects in clinical studies. These mushrooms are not only used in traditional medicine but are also being incorporated into modern medical practices as complementary therapies. Antibiotic Resistance and Fungal Solutions As antibiotic resistance becomes an increasingly severe global health crisis, fungi are being explored for their potential in developing new antimicrobial agents. Fungi produce a wide array of secondary metabolites, many of which have potent antibacterial and antifungal properties. Researchers are investigating these natural compounds to develop novel antibiotics that can combat resistant strains of bacteria. For example, the fungal genus Aspergillus has yielded compounds like aspergillomarasmine, which shows promise in neutralizing antibiotic-resistant bacteria by inhibiting their resistance mechanisms. Fungi in Immunotherapy Fungi are also being used in the field of immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of cancer. Polysaccharides extracted from fungi such as Coriolus versicolor (Turkey tail mushroom) have been shown to modulate the immune system, enhancing the body's natural ability to fight cancer cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated that these fungal polysaccharides can improve the survival rates of cancer patients when used in conjunction with conventional therapies. This burgeoning field of research underscores the potential of fungi to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes. Sustainable Agriculture Fungi are revolutionizing sustainable agriculture through their symbiotic relationships with plants. Mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with plant roots, enhancing water and nutrient uptake, which leads to healthier and more resilient crops. This natural collaboration reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, promoting sustainable farming practices. Mycorrhizal Networks: The Underground Internet Mycorrhizal fungi form extensive networks that connect plant roots, allowing for the transfer of nutrients, water, and even signaling molecules between plants. This underground network, often referred to as the ""Wood Wide Web,"" is crucial for the health and resilience of ecosystems. Plants connected to mycorrhizal networks can share resources and support each other during periods of stress, such as drought or pest infestations. This mutualistic relationship enhances plant growth and productivity, reducing the need for chemical inputs and promoting sustainable agriculture. Organic Fertilizers and Soil Conditioners Fungi are also being used to create organic fertilizers and soil conditioners that improve soil health and fertility. Composting with fungi, particularly with species like Trichoderma, accelerates the decomposition of organic matter, producing nutrient-rich compost that enhances soil structure and fertility. Fungal compost not only provides essential nutrients to plants but also introduces beneficial microorganisms that promote soil health. This sustainable approach to soil management reduces the reliance on synthetic fertilizers, which can lead to soil degradation and environmental pollution. Biopesticides and Pest Control Fungi are increasingly being used as biopesticides to control agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, infect and kill insect pests, providing a natural and eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. These fungi are applied to crops as spores, which then infect and proliferate within the target pests, ultimately leading to their demise. This method of pest control is highly specific, targeting only the pest species while leaving beneficial insects unharmed. The use of fungal biopesticides helps to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and promotes sustainable farming practices. Bioengineering and Material Science The potential of fungi extends into the realm of bioengineering and material science. Fungi can be cultivated to produce biodegradable materials that offer sustainable alternatives to plastics and other non-renewable resources. Mycelium-Based Materials Mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, is being developed into a wide range of sustainable materials. Mycelium-based materials are created by growing fungal mycelium on agricultural waste substrates, which are then molded into various shapes and sizes. These materials are biodegradable, durable, and possess unique properties such as fire resistance and high strength-to-weight ratios. Mycelium-based materials are being used in packaging, construction, and even fashion, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional materials like plastics and Styrofoam. Construction and Architecture In the construction industry, mycelium-based materials are being explored for their potential to create sustainable building materials. Mycelium bricks, for example, are lightweight, strong, and provide excellent insulation properties. These bricks are made by growing mycelium on agricultural waste, which binds the waste particles together to form a solid structure. The resulting bricks are not only environmentally friendly but also offer unique aesthetic qualities. Additionally, mycelium-based materials can be used to create biodegradable insulation panels, reducing the environmental impact of construction and improving the sustainability of buildings. Fashion and Textiles The fashion industry is also exploring the potential of mycelium-based materials to create sustainable textiles. Mycelium leather, for instance, is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional leather made from animal hides. Mycelium leather is produced by growing mycelium on agricultural waste, which is then processed to create a material that mimics the look and feel of leather. This sustainable alternative reduces the environmental impact of leather production, which is associated with deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Mycelium-based textiles offer a promising solution to the environmental challenges facing the fashion industry.
