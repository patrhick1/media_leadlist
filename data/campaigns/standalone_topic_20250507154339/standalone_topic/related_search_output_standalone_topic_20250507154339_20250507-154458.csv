listennotes,3bb7e952a3c54cc5b55010ad9f7e0cf4,Progress Your Health Podcast,"Do you feel like a “hot hormonal mess”?
You are not alone.  Many of us are told we are healthy but don’t feel great.  You feel tired, your sex drive has disappeared and you are frustrated with your weight, despite a healthy diet and exercise. At night you are exhausted, but your sleep quality is poor from waking up throughout the night. 

Needless to say, you’re irritable and your patience is short, which makes you feel guilty for overreacting.  It is not your fault! These are all signs of hormone-imbalances. 

Our hormones can affect our mood, weight, energy, sleep, libido, memory, hair, skin and even promote disease if they are out of balance. 

Dr. Robert Maki and Dr. Valorie Davidson are Naturopathic Physicians and graduates of Bastyr University.  They specialize in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT), Functional Medicine and are the co-hosts of The Progress Your Health Podcast. 

This podcast is intended to educate listeners about hormonal conditions, such as hypothyroid, Hashimoto’s, adrenal fatigue, PMS, PCOS, perimenopause, menopause and low testosterone to name a few.

****TOP 1.5% PODCAST (global ranking)****

Are you discouraged and overwhelmed by autoimmunity or chronic symptoms? Do you want more energy and less anxiety so that you can do “all the things”? Are you searching for meal ideas, essential oils, and other holistic treatments so that you can finally feel better?

In this podcast, you will learn empowering principles and simple, practical solutions that can provide vibrant health to your heart, soul, mind, and body. My mission is to encourage you to seek God’s wisdom first for your health and your life so that you can experience true, lasting healing that will allow you to make a greater eternal impact in your home and community. So, if you’re ready to step into the freedom that God has already given to you, then this podcast is for you.

Hi, I’m Alexandra. I love Jesus. I’m a wife and mom of three children. I am also a driven Registered Nurse with years of experience in the clinical research industry. When I experienced nagging health symptoms of my own, God opened my eyes to his loving provision and powerful tools for health—principles that are rarely talked about in my line of work. When I finally decided to stop my mind-numbing striving towards the picture that I had in my head of ”the next best thing”, I started to see God’s biblical truths at work all around me. I learned that Jesus is the source of healing for every aspect of my life.

Are you ready to discover some powerful, sustainable, non-toxic principles for your health (like real foods, essential oils, and other holistic treatments)? Are you willing to let your creator empower you with his wisdom so that you can experience more energy, joy, peace, and overall healing for your heart, soul, mind, and body? If so, then this is the show for you!

So go ahead and brew some herbal tea. Let’s take a break from the mind-numbing, humdrum “busyness.” Let’s rest and let God be our Healer and Helper.
